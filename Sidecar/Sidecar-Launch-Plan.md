1. "Text us. It gets done." (hero graphic, amber on dark)

3. "We responded to 47 reviews for our clients last month. How many did you?"
4. The 3 tiers — clean pricing graphic
5. "Everything that isn't bartending" — list the 9 services
6. A cocktail photo (stock or yours) + "We handle everything that isn't this."
7. "Your first week is free. No contracts. No BS."

## DAILY HABITS (once you're running)

**Every morning (30 min):**
- Check all client Google/Yelp for new reviews → draft responses
- Check all client inboxes/DMs for anything that needs a reply
- Flag any low-stock alerts from inventory counts

**Every afternoon (1-2 hrs per client):**
- Draft and schedule social posts
- Send any pending POs
- Work on weekly deliverables (reports, audits, event promos)

**Every Friday (1 hr):**
- Send each client a weekly summary: "Here's what we handled this week"
- Quality check: review everything that went out
- Update pipeline and plan next week's outreach

---

## THE ONLY METRIC THAT MATTERS

Paying clients × average revenue per client = MRR

Everything else is a leading indicator. If your MRR isn't growing week over week, you're either not doing enough outreach or not converting trials to paid. Fix whichever one is broken.

Week 2: $500-1,500 MRR
Week 4: $2,000-5,000 MRR  
Week 8: $5,000-8,000 MRR
Week 12: $8,000-12,000 MRR

That's $100k+ ARR in 90 days. From a laptop and a text message.

Go.

## THE 5 THINGS YOU NEED TO DO BEFORE GOING LIVE

### 1. Buy a domain (5 minutes)
Go to **namecheap.com** and search for:
- `sidecarhq.com` (first choice)
- `runsidecar.com` (backup)
- `getsidecar.com` (backup)

Buy whichever is available. Should be ~$12/year.

### 2. Deploy the website (3 minutes)
1. Go to **app.netlify.com** and sign up (free)
2. Drag and drop `index.html` into the deploy area
3. It will give you a random URL like `happy-hamster-123.netlify.app`
4. Go to **Site settings → Domain management → Add custom domain**
5. Enter your domain (e.g. `sidecarhq.com`)
6. Netlify will give you DNS instructions — go to Namecheap and update your nameservers to what Netlify says
7. DNS takes 1-24 hours to propagate. The Netlify URL works immediately.

### 3. Set up Calendly (5 minutes)
1. Go to **calendly.com** and sign up (free)
2. Create a 15-minute event called **"Sidecar — Free Discovery Call"**
3. Set your availability (suggest: Mon-Thu, 10am-5pm)
4. Copy your Calendly link

### 4. Edit the 3 placeholders in index.html (2 minutes)
Open `index.html` in any text editor (TextEdit on Mac works — just right-click → Open With → TextEdit). Search for `CHANGEME` — there are comments marking every spot.

**Find and replace these:**

| Search for | Replace with |
|------------|-------------|
| `href="#"` on all CTA buttons (5 spots) | Your Calendly link, e.g. `href="https://calendly.com/ryan-sidecar/15min"` |
| `ryan@sidecarhq.com` (2 spots) | Your actual email once you set it up |
| The testimonial quote | Keep it for now — replace with a real one after your first client |

To do this fast: open the file, use Cmd+H (Find & Replace):
- Replace `href="#"` with `href="https://calendly.com/YOUR-LINK-HERE"` (but only the CTA buttons, not the # in #pricing — there are comments marking which ones)

### 5. Set up email (5 minutes)
**Easiest option:** Go to **Google Workspace** ($7/mo), add your domain, create `ryan@sidecarhq.com`.

**Free option:** Just use your personal email for now and update the website later. Nobody will judge you for using a Gmail in week one.

## WHAT'S NOT IN THIS FOLDER (and you don't need yet)

| Thing | When You Need It | How to Get It |
|-------|-----------------|---------------|

| Instagram content | Tonight or tomorrow | Use Canva free templates. 9 posts to launch. See launch-plan.md for the 9 topics. |
| Stripe / payment processing | When first client converts to paid | Set up a free Stripe account and send invoices manually. Don't overcomplicate this. |
| Business entity (LLC) | Month 2-3 | You can operate as a sole proprietor to start. Form an LLC when revenue justifies it (~$200 in NY). |

## QUICK REFERENCE — YOUR PITCH

**30-second version:**
"I run the back office for bars and restaurants. You text me what you need — ordering, social media, review responses, hiring posts, menu costing — and it gets handled same day. Like having an ops manager and a marketing person for a fraction of what you'd pay either one. Five hundred a month to start, first week's free."

**One-sentence version:**
"You text me, it gets done — ordering, social media, reviews, all of it."

## GO TIME

Open `launch-plan.md` and start checking boxes. Tonight is setup. Tomorrow you walk into bars.

You have everything you need. The only thing that can stop you now is not starting.

Go.

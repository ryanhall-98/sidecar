# Sidecar — Outreach Playbook v2
## "Text us. It gets done."

---

## THE RULES

1. **Never lead with "AI."** Lead with the problem.
2. **Max 6 sentences in a cold email.**
3. **Always reference something specific about their bar.**
4. **The ask is a 15-minute call or a drop-by — never "buy my thing."**
5. **Follow up once. Two no-responses = move on.**
6. **The pitch is not 9 services. The pitch is: "text me, it gets done."**

---

## THE ONE-LINER

When someone asks "what's Sidecar?" — this is the answer:

> "I'm the back office for bars. You text me what you need — ordering, social media, hiring posts, whatever — and it gets handled same day. Like having an ops manager for a fraction of the cost."

Memorize this. Use it at the bar. Use it in DMs. Use it everywhere.

## COLD EMAIL — First Touch

**Subject lines (rotate):**

- What's costing [Bar Name] 10+ hours a week
- Quick question for [First Name]
- [Bar Name]'s ordering process — can I save you 4 hours?
- Saw [Bar Name]'s new [menu/cocktail/event] — quick idea

---

**Template A — The "Everything" Opener (best for owners you don't know):**

> Hey [First Name],
>
> I work with craft cocktail bars in [neighborhood]. Same story everywhere — ordering takes hours, social media doesn't get done, Yelp reviews pile up, and nobody has time for any of it.
>
> I run Sidecar. You text me what you need and it gets handled — purchase orders, Instagram posts, event promos, hiring posts, review responses, even menu costing. One person, one monthly fee, same-day turnaround.
>
> Worth a 15-minute call? First week is free.
>
> — Ryan

---

**Template B — The Specific Pain (use when you know their weak spot):**

> Hey [First Name],
>
> Noticed [Bar Name] hasn't posted on Instagram in [X weeks / specific observation]. Totally get it — you're running a bar, not a marketing agency.
>
> I handle social media, ordering, and back office for bars in [neighborhood] through a service called Sidecar. You send me a few photos a week, I handle the rest — posts, captions, scheduling, the works. Starting at $750/mo and the first week's free.
>
> Quick call this week?
>
> — Ryan

---

**Template C — The Referral (once you have 1-2 clients):**

> Hey [First Name],
>
> I've been working with [other bar or "a couple bars in the East Village"] — handling their ordering, social media, review responses, and back office. Saved their manager about 10 hours a week.
>
> Would love to do the same for [Bar Name]. It's a service called Sidecar — you text me, it gets done. $750-2,500/mo depending on what you need, first week free.
>
> Worth 15 minutes?
>
> — Ryan

---

## FOLLOW UP (3-4 days later)

> Hey [First Name] — bumping this. Happy to just swing by [Bar Name] for 5 minutes if a call is too much. I'll be in [neighborhood] on [day].
>
> — Ryan

## INSTAGRAM DM

**When to DM:**
- They posted about a new menu item (compliment + pitch)
- They posted a hiring story (you solve this)
- They haven't posted in 2+ weeks (they need help)
- They posted about being busy/understaffed (they need help)

**Template:**

> Hey! Love what you're doing at [Bar Name] — [specific thing].
>
> I run a service called Sidecar — basically your back office in a text message. Ordering, social media, hiring posts, review responses, all of it. You text me, it gets done.
>
> Worth a quick call? First week's on the house.

**If they reply "what's the cost?":**

> Starts at $750/mo for ordering, reviews, and inbox stuff. $1,500 if you want social media and marketing handled too. There's a full plan at $2,500 that covers everything including menu costing and bookkeeping prep. First week's free on any plan so you can see if it's worth it before spending anything.

## IN-PERSON SCRIPT

**You're already at a bar for Pourly. Here's the transition:**

> "So who handles all the non-bartending stuff right now — ordering emails, your Instagram, responding to reviews?"

*[They'll vent about how nobody does it or they do it badly]*

> "Yeah, that's literally why I started Sidecar. You text me, it gets done. I handle ordering, social media, review responses, hiring posts, event promos — all the stuff that eats your time but isn't actually running the bar. $750 a month to start, first week free. Want to try it?"

**If they ask how it works:**

> "Stupid simple. You text me your inventory counts, I draft the POs and email your distributors. You send me a couple photos from the week, I write and schedule your Instagram. Someone leaves a review, I respond in your voice. You need a hiring post, I write it and put it on Poached and Indeed. You need an event promoted, I do the copy, the Eventbrite, and the email blast. Everything gets approved by you before it goes live."

**If they seem interested in more:**

> "If you want to go deeper, we also do menu costing — I can tell you exactly what every cocktail costs you and where your margins are. We do competitor briefs — what other bars nearby are doing with their menus and events. And we prep your books — receipts categorized, invoices organized, so your accountant bills you half the hours."

**Always close with:**

> "Want to try the free week? I just need your distributor list and access to your Instagram. Takes 10 minutes to set up."

## OBJECTION HANDLING

**"$750 is expensive"**
> "Think about it this way — your manager spends at least 4 hours a week on ordering alone. That's 16 hours a month at $30/hr = $480 just in labor, and they're off the floor. Add the social media and review responses you're not doing, and the revenue you're leaving on the table. Sidecar pays for itself in the first month."

**"We have someone who does social media"**
> "How much are you paying them? NYC freelance social media is $2-3k/month for 4 posts a week. I do that plus ordering, reviews, hiring, and inbox for $1,500 total. And if your current person is great, I can just handle the ops side for $750."

**"I don't trust AI"**
> "Smart. Everything goes through me first — you're not talking to a bot, you're texting a person. I use AI tools to work fast, but you approve every post, every email, every order before it goes out. It's a human service powered by smart tools."

**"Can I just use ChatGPT?"**
> "Absolutely. But will you? The bars I work with know they could do this themselves but it never gets done. The value isn't the AI — it's that you text me and don't think about it again."

**"What if I want to cancel?"**
> "Cancel anytime. No contracts, no penalties. If I'm not saving you time, you shouldn't be paying me."

**"Let me think about it"**
> "Totally. The free week is standing whenever you're ready — just text me. Here's my card."

---

## UPSELL PLAYBOOK

This is where you go from $750 clients to $1,500-2,500 clients.

**Week 2-3 (after they're on The Well):**
> "Hey [First Name] — noticed you guys haven't posted in a while. I could add social media to your plan — 4 posts a week, I just need a couple photos. Would be $1,500/mo total instead of $750. Want to try it for a week?"

**Month 2 (once they trust you):**
> "I pulled some rough numbers on your cocktail costs based on what I've seen in your orders. A few of your top sellers might be underpriced. Want me to do a full menu costing analysis? $500 one-time, or I can roll it into a Full Pour plan at $2,500/mo which covers everything."

**When they mention an event:**
> "Want me to handle that? I'll do the copy, build the Eventbrite, draft the email blast, and schedule the social posts. $300 add-on, or it's already included in The Double."

**When they complain about hiring:**
> "I can write that listing and post it to Poached, Indeed, and your socials today. $200 per role, or it's included if you move to The Double."

## PROSPECT SOURCING

**Warm (start here):**
- Bars you already know from Pourly
- Friends of friends in the industry
- Bartenders you've talked to — ask "would your owner be open to this?"

**Instagram hunting:**
- #eastvillagebar #nyccocktails #craftcocktailsnyc #nycbartender
- Look for bars that post inconsistently — that's your signal
- Look for bars that post well but never respond to comments — they need review/inbox help

**Yelp + Google Maps:**
- Search "cocktail bars" by Manhattan neighborhood
- Sort by newest reviews to find active spots
- Note bars with lots of unanswered reviews — that's your lead

**Industry:**
- Tales of the Cocktail local events
- Bar industry nights
- Restaurant industry Facebook/Reddit groups (lurk, don't spam)
